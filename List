1.Challenge: Remove Even Integers From List
Statement
Given a list of integers, lst, remove all the even integers from the list.
def remove_even(lst):

    # Replace this placeholder return statement with your code
        return [num for num in lst if num % 2 != 0]

2.Merge sorted List
Challenge: Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single list sorted in nondecreasing order.
def mergeTwoLists(l1, l2):
    # --- Setup Phase ---
    # "Create a dummy node to simplify the head logic."
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    # "Use a 'curr' pointer to build the new list."
    curr = dummy
    
    # --- Loop Phase ---
    # "While both lists are not empty..."
    while l1 and l2:
        # "Compare the values of the current nodes."
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            # "If l1 is smaller, attach it to our list."
            curr.next = l1
            # "And move the l1 pointer forward."
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            # "Otherwise, attach l2."
            curr.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        
        # "Move the 'curr' pointer to the next position."
        curr = curr.next
        
    # --- Wrap-up Phase ---
    # "If one list is exhausted, append the remaining part of the other."
    curr.next = l1 if l1 else l2
    
    # "Return the next node of dummy, which is the actual head."
    return dummy.next
